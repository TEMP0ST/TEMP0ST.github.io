This website is my attempt to consolidate some of the projects, hacks and other digital bits and pieces I work on. Like most people who work in eResearch I manage to leave a trail of unfinshed code, files and other stuff scattered across my various folders and hard drives. I'm trying to use this website to curate and consilidate some of the work that I do so it's at least in some presentable for that may be of use to someone.

Digitising the directories opens ways to programmatically insert geo-spatial coordinates into these files to various levels of granularity.
