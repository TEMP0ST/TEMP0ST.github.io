This website is my attempt to consolidate some of the projects, hacks and other digital bits and pieces I work on. Like most people who work in eResearch I manage to leave a trail of unfinshed code, files and other stuff strewn across my various folders, hard drives and server. I'm trying to use this website to curate and consolidate some of my recent work in a presentable form.
