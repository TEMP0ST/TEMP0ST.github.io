# Live Coding Environments
 
**CloudStor SWAN** - https://www.aarnet.edu.au/network-and-services/cloud-services/cloudstor
 
SWAN (Service for Web-based ANalysis) allows researchers to perform interactive data analysis in CloudStor using a web browser and without the need to install any software. 

Jupyter Notebooks can be launched through SWAN to process research data using cloud computing services.
Researchers can easily share their Jupyter Notebook files and data with collaborators within and between institutions through CloudStor’s file sharing capabilities.

SWAN comes with a default set of code libraries for R and Python programming languages.
 
 
 
**RStudio Cloud** - https://rstudio.cloud/learn/guide 
Create your analyses using RStudio directly from your browser - there is no software to install and nothing to configure on your computer. Every RStudio Cloud user gets a personal workspace.

A project is the fundamental unit of work on RStudio Cloud. It encapsulates your R code, packages and data files and provides isolation from other analyses. To create a new project from an existing git repository, press the down arrow on the right side of the New Project button, and choose ‘New Project from Git Repo’
 
 
**Repl.it** - https://repl.it
Code right in your browser in 50+ programming languages without spending a second on setup. Repl.it is a simple yet powerful collaborative browser based IDE
 
 
**Glitch**  - https://glitch.com
A simple tool for creating web apps. Glitch is an experimental web development sandbox.
