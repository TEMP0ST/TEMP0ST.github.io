# Live Coding Environments
There are a number of free online services designed to help you learn a new prohgramming language or conduct an analysise of your own data directly from your browser. Most come supported with a number of tutorials to get you started, and the best part is there's no software to install and nothing to configure on your computer.

SWAN (Service for Web-based ANalysis) allows researchers to perform interactive data analysis in CloudStor using a web browser and without the need to install any software. 

Researchers can easily share their Jupyter Notebook files and data with collaborators within and between institutions through CloudStor’s file sharing capabilities. SWAN comes with a default set of code libraries for R and Python programming languages.
